## PrecisionApi.Services.AnalysisService

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the actual C# codebase analysis, converting it into a graph structure.

**Current State (as of last update):**

*   **Dependencies (Planned/Implicit):** 
    *   Buildalyzer library (for project/solution parsing).
    *   Roslyn (Microsoft.CodeAnalysis) (for code analysis).
    *   `PrecisionApi.Domain` classes (copied/adapted from Strazh).
    *   `PrecisionApi.Analysis.Extractor` (copied/adapted from Strazh).
    *   (Potentially `ILogger` for logging, to be injected).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **`public async Task<JsonDocument> AnalyzeCodebaseAsync(string extractedCodebasePath)`**
        *   **Input:** `string extractedCodebasePath` - The path to the directory where the uploaded codebase (from the .zip) has been extracted.
        *   **Current Functionality (Placeholder):**
            1.  Simulates a brief asynchronous delay (`await Task.Delay(100)`).
            2.  Lists all files found in the `extractedCodebasePath` (recursive).
            3.  Constructs a placeholder JSON object containing:
                *   A message: "Analysis service called. Actual analysis not yet implemented."
                *   The `sourcePath` (the input `extractedCodebasePath`).
                *   The `discoveredFiles` list.
                *   Empty `nodes` and `edges` arrays.
            4.  Serializes this placeholder object to a string and then parses it into a `JsonDocument` which is returned.
        *   **Planned Functionality (Detailed in TODO comments within the method and in overall plan):**
            1.  Scan `extractedCodebasePath` for `.sln` or `.csproj` files to determine analysis targets.
            2.  Initialize Buildalyzer's `AnalyzerManager`.
            3.  Use Roslyn to get workspace, compilations, and semantic models.
            4.  Adapt and use logic from `Strazh.Analysis.Analyzer` and `PrecisionApi.Analysis.Extractor` to generate `Triple` objects.
            5.  Collect and deduplicate these `Triple` objects.
            6.  Transform the list of `Triple` objects into the specified JSON structure (`{ "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }`).
            7.  Return the final graph as a `JsonDocument`.
*   **Notable Placeholders/TODOs (in Service):** 
    *   The entire core analysis logic is yet to be implemented (currently placeholder).
    *   Implementation of project/solution file discovery.
    *   Integration and adaptation of Strazh's domain and analysis code.
    *   JSON transformation logic.
    *   Robust error handling and logging.
